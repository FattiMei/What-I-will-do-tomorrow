# What-I-will-do-tomorrow
Every document and source for learning I know, and some of the projects I will tackle in the next years.

# HAVING A STRUCTURED APPROACH IS A MUST

# Project Euler
https://projecteuler.net/
Math related problems, I need to develop a tool for handling very big integer numbers.

# Raspberry PI
Interesting tool. I used to work on simple C projects. Many ideas comes from using simple softwares.
I want to develop a simple Real Time Clock with Arduino because Raspberry doesn't keep time when it's not connected to power (the RTC module will have a small battery)

Also I need a way to have source code files formatted with the rules I want. When transferring files from Windows to Raspberry in the editor nano the format is messed up.

# Rosetta code
https://rosettacode.org
In particular the classic computer science problems and programs, and all I need to know about computer science.
I want to follow the categories to build a mental structure. 

# A list of classic problems in computer science

There aren't explanations for each problem although.

# Mathematics
The mathematics olimpics are a useful resource of ideas and stimuli

# Microcontroller side
